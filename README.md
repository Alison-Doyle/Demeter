# Demeter
## 🪴 Descripton
Demeter is a mock up of a gardening app. The app should allow users to view the condition of their plants no matter where they are and be able to tailor the care they receive (if this were a 100% functional and real application, this would be connected to a device that would water the plant and make sure it has the right amount of light).
